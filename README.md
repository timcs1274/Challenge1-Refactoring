# challenge1-refactoring
1. First step was to set up my own Repository with the cloned files that were provided. 
2. Find the source code.
3. Refactored the markup in such a way that got rid of non-semantic elements. This process mostly involved switching out div and span elements with nav elements. However, in some places section,aside,footer,header, and figure tags were also used for further clarity. During this process spacing was reduced in some areas and increased in other areas of the markup to make it easier to read.
4. Examining the structure of the HTML 
5. Adding comments about the structure of the HTML markup making note of the order it's in.
6. Adding comments about image elements and placements.
7. Adding alt attributes to the images for accessibility.
